# ESD1_Lab2
In this lab I was tasked with doing the following:
•	Read an 8 bit number from the switches SW0 through SW7.
•	Add the 8 bit number read from the switches to a 16 bit accumulator when push-button KEY1 is pressed.
•	Display the 16 bit accumulator in hex on the seven segment displays HEX0 through HEX3.
•	Reset the system when KEY0 is pressed. Reset should also zero the accumulator.

Using the following ways: 
1.	Using only VHDL.
2.	Using a Nios processor to implement the accumulator. In this part used C code.
3.	Using a Nios processor with main code written in assembly language.
4.	Using a Nios processor with C code, but this time generating an interrupt when KEY1 is pressed
